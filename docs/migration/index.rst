LOCKSS 1.x to 2.x Migration Guide
=================================

*Last updated: 2025-02-13*

**Welcome, LOCKSS 1.x users!**

This document will guide you as you upgrade from LOCKSS |UPGRADE_FROM_MINOR| to LOCKSS |UPGRADE_TO_MINOR| by performing a migration of the data you preserve from LOCKSS |UPGRADE_FROM_PATCH| to LOCKSS |UPGRADE_TO_PATCH|.

.. important::

   At this time, LOCKSS nodes in the Global LOCKSS Network (GLN) and CLOCKSS are advised to wait until LOCKSS 2.0-beta2 or later before migrating to LOCKSS 2.x, as development work for additional performance and scalability improvements is underway to support the migration of GLN-sized or CLOCKSS-sized nodes.

The next task is to install LOCKSS 2.0-beta1.

To do so, follow the instructions in chapter 3 (:doc:`lockss-manual:installing/index`) of the LOCKSS 2.0-beta1 System Manual.

.. note::

   If you are doing a **same-host migration**, you do not need to apply section 3.1 (:doc:`lockss-manual:installing/user`) of the LOCKSS 2.0-beta1 System Manual, as the ``lockss`` user already exists on the host in this scenario.

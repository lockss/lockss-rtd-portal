REST APIs
=========

The API of each LOCKSS REST service is described in OpenAPI 3 specification, which can be found relative to the root of the component's Git repository in the file :file:`src/main/resources/swagger/swagger.yaml`. The specification can be used as input into another tool, to produce clients and server stubs in a variety of languages and frameworks, and documentation. This guide contains HTML renderings of each specification generated with `Swagger Codegen <https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen>`_.
